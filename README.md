# PV217 Freelance Marketplace
## Overview
This project is a microservices-based marketplace platform designed to connect freelancers with customers seeking custom project development.
It is a platform where users (freelancers) can publish their services as ‘gigs’, buyers can search for these gigs, message each other, and make secure purchases.
